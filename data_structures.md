# Data Structures

## Arrays

## Linked List

## Stack 
Operate on “last-in, first-out”(LIFO)behavior. The last, most recently added item, is the first to be removed.
#### Example: 
 “back” button on your browser.
 #### Big O
| Function  | Complexity|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Access | O(1) |
| Insert | O(1)  |
| Delete  | O(1)  |
| Check empty | O(1) |


## Queues
Operate on “first-in, first-out”(FIFO) behavior. Items are removed in the order they were added, from first to last.
#### Example: 
The ordeer of print document using FIFO.
#### Big O:
| Function  | Complexity|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Access | O(1) |
| Insert | O(1)  |
| Delete  | O(1)  |
| Check empty | O(1) |
